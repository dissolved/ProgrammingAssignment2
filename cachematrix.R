## These two functions work in tandam to create a special cached version of a matrix, so that
## solving for the inverse of the matrix (which is potentially time consuming), can be cached for
## future access without computing again. Example usage is as follows:
##   > cm <- makeCacheMatrix(matrix(c(2,2,3,2), nrow=2, ncol=2))
##   > cacheSolve(cm)
##        [,1] [,2]
##   [1,]   -1  1.5
##   [2,]    1 -1.0


## makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing these functions:
##   set()        - set the value of the matrix
##   get()        - return the value of the matrix
##   setinverse() - set the value of the inverse matrix
##   getinverse() - return the value of the stored inverse matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}


## cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve
## will retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)){
    inv
  }
  else{
    inv <- solve(x$get())
    x$setinverse(inv)
    inv
  }
}
